    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I’m a learning programmer focused on topics like Machine Learning, AI, and a bit of Emulation. I’ve mainly coded in languages like C#/Java, Python, and Rust so far but I’m starting to learn other languages like C and have experience in Octave/Matlab.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>To see the code I’ve written and compiled for this website, click <a href="https://github.com/ThunderingWest4/thunderingwest4.github.io">here</a>. The reason that some of the HTML files look like gibberish is because I wrote the code/text in R Markdown files and compiled it from there into HTML. At the moment, I'm trying to move all the files from RMD to HTML so that I can use a built in preview feature to better build them To see my github account which has repositories of all of my projects, completed and finished, click <a href="https://github.com/ThunderingWest4/">here</a>.</p>

    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <hr>

        <h2>Completed</h2>
    
            <p>I have several completed projects, which you can see (and experiment with!) by hovering over the “Completed Projects” tab in the header menu at the top of the page.</p>

        <h2>In Progress</h2>

            <p> At the moment, I'm working on a course about Natural Language Processing so updated to this site will likely take a bit. Aside from that, I have a couple of projects in the background - a Chip-8 Emulator in Rust and a Useless Box </p>

    <h1>Website Updates</h1>
    <hr>

        <p>At the moment, there are several pages on this website that I’ve added as placeholders of sorts - the tabs are there but it redirects you to an Under Construction page because I haven’t had much of a chance to finish building those pages yet. However, I’ll have an updated list below of pages that are currently finished, in progress, and not yet started.
        </p>

        <h2>Finished Pages</h2>
        
            <p> 
                Well technically, none because I’ll always be improving the pages if I find a place to improve them. However, the ones that are probably the most finished and will have minimal revisions are: 
                <br>
                - The Homepage
                <br>
                - The Iris Flower page is mostly complete with only a small issue - the Tensorflow network isn’t embedded because I can’t find any online emulators for it. However, I’ll try to fix it in the future.
            </p>
        <h2>Pages In-Progress</h2>
            <p>
                - Hunt the Wumpus
                <br>
            </p>
        <h2>To Be Started</h2>
        <p>
            The not yet started pages on the website with just placeholders are:
            <br>
            <br>
            - Chip-8 Emulator
            <br>
            - Pathfinding Snake
        </p>

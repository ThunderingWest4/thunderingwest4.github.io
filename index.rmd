## About
***

I'm a learning programmer focused on topics like Machine Learning, AI, and a bit of Emulation. I've mainly coded in languages like C#/Java, Python, and Rust so far but I'm starting to learn other languages like C and have experience in Octave/Matlab. 

## Projects

### Completed

I have several completed projects, which you can see (and experiment with!) by clicking on the links below

### In Progress

At the moment, I'm working on a couple of projects: 

+ Chip-8 Emulator
+ Useless Box

When they're complete, I'll put them on this website.
